        <p class="font1"> <span><u><b>Story:-</b></u> </span> <br>

            Bhama shah was born in 1542 in a Jain family. His father Bharmal Kawedia was Qiledar of Ranthambore Fort appointed by Rana Sanga and was later prime minister under Maharana Udai Singh II.


            Bhamas Shah was a great General, Adviser, Minister of Mewar, who was later promoted to post of Prime Minister of Mewar by Maharana Pratap, to whom he served as close aide and confidant.
            Akbar's intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar, sent a proposal to Maharana Pratap. Denying it, both forces came down to the battlefield- Haldigathi. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda in Rajasthan. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of around 3,000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Raja Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 5,000–10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting for more than three hours, Pratap found himself wounded and the day lost. While a few of his men bought him time, he was forced to make an escape by Jhala Man Singh to the hills and lived to fight another day. Wounded Maharana Pratap managed to escape but eventually lost the battle. As a result of the defeat, the king of Mewar had no funds at all to carry on the fight and his family was already starving. Bhama Shah was the Nagar Seth of Chittor. After Maharana Pratap was defeated by Akbar in the Battle of Haldighati, at this point, Bhama shah and his brother Tarachand, presented their wealth consisting of 2,00,00,000 gold coins and 25,00,00,000 silver rupees to Maharana Pratap, who was overwhelmed. They, being skilled in war-fare, attacked Mughal army camps and won a lot of wealth from Mughals; from which they partially financed the Maharana. This contribution helped the king a lot who was now able to fund the army and continue the fight against the Mughals.
            
            
            Bhama shah died in 1600 and at the time of his death he was in-charge of Mewar's treasury under Amar Singh I. Descendants of Bhama Shah also served as prime ministers of the Maharanas of Udaipur for a few generations. His son Jiwashah was the chief during the rule of Maharana Amar Singh, and grandson Akshayraj was the Prime Minister during the rule of Maharana Karan Singh and his descendant Rana Jagat Singh.
            There is a memorial in Udaipur in honour of the great patriot. Government of India has issued a postage stamp in his honour in year 2000. The Maharana Mewar Charitable Foundation has instituted the "Bhama shah Award".

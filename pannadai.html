        <p class="font1"> <span><u><b>Introduction</b></u> </span> <br>
            History of Chittorgarh, where the immortals of Padmini's Jauhar resonate
             with the devotional songs of Meera, the story of the lordly devotion of a woman like Pannadhai also holds its place
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="font1"> <span><u><b>Story:-</b></u> </span> <br>


            Panna Dai (also spelled Panna Dhai) was a 16th-century nursemaid to Udai Singh II, the fourth son of Maharana Sangram Singh. In Hindi, Panna means "emerald," and dai means "nurse." Not to forget, Panna Dai was a widow. She had a son named Chandan who was of the same age as Udai. From the day of Udai Singh’s birth, Panna always looked after him as his son.

Udai Singh was born in 1522. He was the youngest among them. He was just an infant when his father, Rana Sanga took his last breath in 1528. It was an entirely hard phase for Mewar. Bhojraj was also killed while fighting for Mewar in 1526 when Rana Sanga was alive. After Rana Sanga’s death, his eldest son ascended the throne as Rana Ratan Singh. He just ruled Mewar for four years (1528 to 1531) as he died in a battle.

Now responsibilities are given to Vikramaditya who was an immodest and disrespectful King. His arrogance was intolerable. In 1536, Vikramaditya’s behavior crossed all the limits. He abused a respected old chieftain at the Court. As a lesson, Vikramaditya was punished and sent to the palace arrest by nobles. Thus, the youngest of all, Udai Singh was declared as ‘The New King of Mewar’.

Udai Singh was too young to take the responsibility of Mewar and understand political matters. So, the nobles invited Banvir to guard Udai Singh as well as to take care of other matters as his regent. Well, Banvir was the illicit son of Rana Sanga’s elder brother, Prithviraj. Prithviraj was the Crown Prince but because of his fight with Rana Sanga, he was sent to exile. He eventually died there.

Prithviraj never succeeded to rule as Maharana of Mewar. In a way, Banvir considered himself as the rightful heir to the throne. But, he had two hurdles in his way. Banvir somehow conspired to kill both the hurdles. I mean brothers. Taking advantage of Vikramaditya’s arrest, Banvir assassinated Vikramaditya. Now, he hurried towards the only remaining hurdle to his ambition, the 14-year-old, Udai Singh.

It was night. Panna Dai arranged the bed for both Chandan and Udai. In a few minutes, a maidservant who was aware of Banvir’s intention hurried and informed Panna Dai that Banvir was coming with a sword in hand to kill Udai Singh. She knew that Udai Singh was the last hope to safeguard Mewar.

Now, she was left with two choices. Either she could save her son’s life or she could save Mewar’s life. She chose Mewar. Both Udai and Chandan were sleeping firmly. She instructed the loyal servant to take Udai Singh into a large basket filled with flowers and safely draw him out of the reach of Banvir, by the bank of the river and said she would join them there. After the servant left, She summoned all her courage and lifted her only reason to live, Chandan from his bed and placed him on Prince’s bed, covering him with a blanket. She knew what was going to be the result of her decision but she also knew what was necessary.

A blood-thirsty sword was on its way to take Udai Singh’s life. Well, Banvir had no idea whose life his sword was going to take. In a moment, Banvir entered the room. When asked about Udai Singh, Panna Dai pointed towards the bed. The moment of horror took place. Panna saw how Banvir murdered her son. A part of her wanted to cry her heart out but she did not react at all, as if she wanted to deny it, all of it.

After that Banvir proclaimed himself as the new King of Mewar. When Banvir was celebrating his victory, Panna Dai was standing still, seeing her son’s cremation. She knew, there was no time to shed tears which were tearing her apart from inside.

Then she packed necessary items in a bag and hurried towards the river. She then decided to up-bring Udai in a different place where he will be safe and no one will know them. The loyal servants took the oath for Mewar’s future, never to mention a word of what had happened that tragic night.

After several weeks, while she was in search of help from other chieftains, they arrived at Kumbhalgarh. The local governor of Maheshwari cast named Asha Devpura Shah agreed to provide them with a roof. For a couple of years, Udai Singh was known as Asha Shah’s nephew.

Four years passed and Udai Singh was married to a Rajput Princess. In 1540, when Udai Singh was 18, Panna knew he was ready to defeat Banvir. Thus, Panna Dai contacted the chieftains of Mewar and revealed to them the full story of the deception and the escape.

After knowing the truth, Rajput chieftains joined Udai Singh in the revolt against Banvir. He marched on Chittor to reclaim his throne with the help of the Mewar and Marwar force. Thus, Banvir was defeated, in the battle fought near Maholi.

At last, Udai Singh rode to his kingdom and was crowned as the Maharana of Mewar. Mewar was in the right hands, because of just one lady. The lady who sacrificed her son for Mewar. The Iron Lady!

Panna Dai was like a mother to Udai Singh. Udai Singh knew there was no way he could repay what Panna Dai did for him and Mewar. Not only Udai Singh but the whole Mewar was in debt to Panna Dai’s incomparable sacrifice.

Though Panna Dai was not a queen she was no less than that.
You are a true woman of India, who taught sacrifice.
